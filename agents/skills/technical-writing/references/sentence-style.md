# Sentence and procedure guidance

Use these conventions when editing dense or ambiguous technical documentation. Apply judgment when a convention makes the text worse.

## Write sentences to the reader (Google developer style)

- Talk to the reader as "you", in the present tense. "Will" only for things that genuinely happen later.
- Say who does what: "the compiler checks", not "is checked". Passive is fine only when the actor is unknown or beside the point.
- Write instructions as commands: "Click Submit." State facts plainly. Never "should be done".
- Put the condition before the instruction: "To delete the document, click Delete." The reader skips what does not apply.
- Put the common case first. Exceptions after.
- Sound like a knowledgeable friend. No buzzwords, no figurative language, no "please" in instructions, and never "simply", "easy", or "quickly" in a procedure. If it were simple, the reader would not be here.
- Don't pre-announce ("we will soon support...") and don't start consecutive sentences with the same phrase.
- Link with words that say where the link goes: the page title or a short description. Never "click here". Prefer a sentence of context on the page over a link off it.
- Headings carry the point, not just the topic ("Pick the mode first", not "Modes"). Sentence case. A task heading is a bare verb phrase ("Create an instance"). A concept heading is a noun phrase. One h1 per page, no skipped levels.
- Numbered lists for sequences, bullets for everything else. Introduce a list with a complete sentence. Keep items parallel.
- Code goes in code font. UI elements go in bold. Use serial commas. Drop "etc." and say up front that a list is partial.

## Make statements load one at a time (STE rules)

- One instruction per sentence. One thought per sentence everywhere else.
- Split a sentence when its clauses make the reader backtrack. Keep a longer sentence when it expresses one clear idea.
- Put the warning or condition before the step it guards: "If hot oil touches your skin, injuries can occur."
- Keep "the" and "a": "Remove backup file" reads two ways. "Remove the backup file" reads one.
- Give each word one meaning and one job, then keep it. If "check" means inspect, don't also use it for restrain.
- Pick one word per action and stick to it: "start", not "start" here and "initiate" there.
- Write procedures as direct commands, never as narration and never in the passive: "Install the component", not "the component must be installed".
- Avoid "-ing" words where you can. They take too many grammatical jobs and breed misreadings.

## Leave no sentence open to two readings (Global English)

- Keep words like "only" and "not" next to the word they change: "only fails on growth" and "fails only on growth" say different things.
- Break up long noun strings: "the proto import budget check script" becomes "the script that checks the proto-import budget".
- Make every "it", "they", and "this" point at one obvious thing. Repeat the noun when in doubt. Name the subject again when "this" or "which" could refer to more than one thing.
- Don't drop verbs: "Phase 1 moves the converters and Phase 2 the runtime" leaves Phase 2 without one. Give it one.
- Keep the small words that show structure. "Ensure that the switch is off" keeps "that" because it makes the sentence parse one way. Never trade clarity for word count.
- Repeat the article in a series when it prevents a misread: "the client and the host", not "the client and host", when they are two things.
- Say which parts "and" or "or" joins when a sentence can group two ways. "Both...and", "either...or", and "if...then" are free disambiguators.
- Use periods, not semicolons. Replace an em dash with a new sentence.
- Make text in parentheses a full grammatical unit or its own sentence. Never form plurals with "(s)".
- Replace a slash with words when it makes the relationship ambiguous. Preserve real paths, symbols, and established notation.
- Call each thing by one name, everywhere. A doc that says "the gate", "the ratchet", and "the budget check" for one thing teaches three things. Avoid rewording unchanged content without a clear benefit.
- Skip idioms, colloquialisms, Latin abbreviations, and metaphors. A non-native reader, a translator, and an agent all parse plain constructions best.
